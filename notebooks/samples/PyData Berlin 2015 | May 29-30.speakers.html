          When it comes to ownership, the internet is broken. Artists, designers, and other creatives can share their work easily on the internet, but keeping it as "theirs" and get fairly compensated has proven difficult. How do you "own" something when bits can be copied freely? It turns out that visionaries of hypertext foresaw this issue in the 60s. They even proposed systems to handle this. However, those systems were too complex and hard to build. By the early 90s, the simpler WWW had won, but unfortunately in its simplicity it left out attribution to owners. We ask a new question: can we retrofit the internet for ownership? It turns out the answer is yes, with the help of python-powered big data, machine learning, and the blockchain. First, we crawl the internet and create a large scale crawl database, then preprocess all media into machine learning features. Then, creators can "register" their work onto the blockchain. Finally, we use machine learning to cross-reference registered works against the large-scale crawl database. We can do this for images, text, and even 3d designs; and it works even if the design has changed meaningfully. Python-powered big data is making it possible to revive the dream of ownership on the internet.

          T. Davenport and DJ Patil have pointed out already in 2012 that Data Scientists are working in the “sexiest job of the 21st century”. Although there are plenty of imaginations what a Data Scientist actually does, core skills for this job definitely include Machine Learning, software development, and business domain expertise.<br><br>The talk will give a short tour through these key aspects and a glimpse of the working life of a Data Scientist at Blue Yonder. We build predictive applications for customers from various business fields or, to put it in another way, deliver productive data science as a service. Thereby, we make extensive use of the Python ecosystem and leverage it to overcome the two-language problem for rapid prototyping (instead of e.g. R) and productive operation (instead of e.g. C++) in different project phases.

          Although not exactly a classical big data application, the numerical treatment of partial differential equations (PDEs) has very similar characteristics: By spatial discretization, the continuous problem is translated to linear systems and the discrete solution is represented by a vector of floating point numbers. Depending on the dimensions of the domain and the granularity of the spatial discretization, the size of the arising matrices and vectors may range from a few thousands to billions of entries. Usual operations include matrix-vector multiplications, the solution of linear systems and more complicated tasks like the solution of eigenvalue problems.<br><br>Due to usually large problem sizes, computational performance is certainly a main design goal of PDE solvers. However, when it comes to the implementation of complex PDEs or algorithms in general it is equally desirable to use high level programming tools that allow a concise domain-related problem definition.<br><br>Recently, Python gained a lot of attention in the scientific computing community that was dominated by compiled languages as Fortran and C for a long time. The reason for this development is most likely the fulfillment of the above mentioned criteria: performance and brief syntax. While the brief syntax is a feature of the language itself, Python owes its high performance the existence of excellent third party libraries such as NumPy. Many novel scientific special purpose libraries are still written in compiled languages, but come with Python wrappers and seamlessly integrate with NumPy.<br><br>The aim of this talk is to give a brief introduction to the problem domain and present a selection of Python tools and libraries for scientific computing with a focus on continuous problems.

          Classification, in the context of machine learning, deals with the problem of predicting the class of a set of examples given their features. Traditionally, classification methods aim at minimizing the misclassification of examples, in which an example is misclassified if the predicted class is different from the true class. Such a traditional framework assumes that all misclassification errors carry the same cost. This is not the case in many real-world applications such as credit card fraud detection, credit scoring, churn modeling and direct marketing. In this talk I would like to present CostCla a cost-sensitive classification library. The library incorporates several cost-sensitive algorithms. Moreover, during the talk I will show the huge differences in profit when using traditional machine learning algorithms versus cost-sensitive algorithms, on several real-world databases.

          The city of Dresden has an excellent traffic monitoring and guiding system (VAMOS), which also measures the occupancy rate of city parking spaces. The data is pushed to the city's website, from which it has been scraped by Dresden's Open Data activists for the past year. This talk shows, how to analyse the data with Pandas and make predictions of future occupation with SciKit-Learn. Especially, which features are important for predicting the shopping behavior of citizens and tourists.

          A very simple tutorial, ideally aimed at beginners, for both Docker and scientific Python, who wish to learn the basics to be able to create and manage their own development environments, using Docker.<br><br>We'll write a Dockerfile to build a Docker image that will have a few basic scientific libraries (matplotlib, numpy, ipython/jupyter notebook). We'll run the notebook in the docker container, and then learn how to interact with the notebook.<br><br>Next step, we'll use docker-machine to run our docker container on a remote host. (This may be practical for performance reasons.)<br><br>If time allows, we may also spin up another container, running Postgres, or another data store (e.g.: Redis, Elasticsearch). We'll tie in the communication between both containers using docker-compose. We'll figure out a way of storing some data in our data store and plotting some graphs for it in the notebook.<br><br>The goal of the tutorial is to empower the developers, such that they can totally take over their own development environment, meanwhile leveraging what Docker has to offer to do so. Hence, the tutorial will adopt a pace that beginners will be able to follow, such that at the end, they will have completed a re-usable Docker-based development environment, which they may extend and modify according to theirs needs, in the future. <br><br><a href="https://goo.gl/puCqyd">Tutorial prerequisites and instructions.</a>

          A lot of studies have investigated lately how happy and engaged people are at work. They found that a big influencer is the team atmosphere and the relationship you have with your boss. <br><br>Being engaged describes a state where you feel energized, involved and effective. Looking at the numbers, we'll find that there are only about 16% of people that are truly engaged at work. <br><br>The talk will give an insight on things that lead to a happier work environment, give inspiration for what you can do to actively shape a happy work environment and how this will establish the foundation for more diversity within your team.

There are numerous interesting applications such as to Quantitative Finance.<br>I'll discuss what probabilistic programming is, why should you care and how to use PyMC and PyMC3 from Python to implement these methods. I'll be applying these methods to studying the problem of 'rugby sports analytics' particularly how to model the winning team in the recent Six Nations in Rugby.

          Python is the perfect language to build with little effort a framework to control and hack the growth of a company. Being import.io data scientist for the last 2 years, I've come across many different problems and needs on how to wrangle data, clean data, report on it and make predictions. In this talk I will cover all main analytics and data science needs of a start-up using Python, numpy, pandas, and sklearn. We will go through examples of how to wrangle analytics and KPIs in Python, and make simple models to do basic predictions that can really make the difference in the business world. For every use case I there will be snippets of code using IPython notebooks and some will be run as live demos.

          Blosc is a fast metacodec with two main features: the shuffle filter and threading. The shuffle filter, which is implemented using SSE2 instructions, allows reordering bytes to reduce the complexity of certain datasets. Threading, on the other hand, allows parallelization of existing codecs, hence the term *metacodec*. Blosc was originally conceived to mitigate the problem of starving CPUs which results from the ever growing divide between clock speed and memory latency. Recently, it has become increasingly useful for other scenarios too, for example, out-of-core approaches and compressed in-memory storage.  Blosc has a small codebase and is implemented in C. Additionally, several pieces of interesting software, largely written in Python, have emerged that make use of Blosc, showcasing it's potential and exploring the new use-cases. Bcolz, for example, is a compressed in-memory and out-of-core container for numerical data. This talk is about Blosc and it's Python friends.

          Apache Spark is a computational engine for large-scale data processing. It is responsible for scheduling, distribution and monitoring applications which consist of many computational task across many worker machines on a computing cluster.<br><br>This talk will give an overview of the PySpark DataFrame API. While Spark core itself is written in Scala and runs on the JVM, PySpark exposes the Spark programming model to Python. The Spark DataFrame API was introduced in Spark 1.3. DataFrames envolve Spark's Resiliant Distributed Datasets model and are inspired by Pandas and R data frames. The API provides simplified operators for filtering, aggregating, and projecting over large datasets. The DataFrame API supports diffferent data sources like JSON datasources, Parquet files, Hive tables and JDBC database connections.

          In a lot of our Data Science customer engagements at Pivotal, the question comes up how to put the developed Data Science models into production. Usually, the code produced by the Data Scientist is a bunch of scripts that go from data loading over data cleansing to feature extraction and then model training. There is rarely much thought put into how the resulting model can be used by other pieces of software and this is generally not a good practice of encapsulating the Data Scientist's work for others to re-use.<br><br>What we as Data Scientists want is to create models that drive automated decision-making but there is clearly a mismatch to the above way of going about Big Data projects. Considering these challenges, we created a small prototype for a Data Science operationalization framework. This allows the Data Scientist to implement a model which is exposed by the framework as a REST API for easy access by software developers.<br><br>The difference to other predictive APIs is that this framework allows for automatic periodic retraining of the implemented model on incoming streaming data and is able to free the Data Scientist of some tedious work - like Ÿkeeping track of results for different modelling and feature engineering approaches, basic visualization of model performance and the creation of multiple model instances for different data streams. It is written by practitioning Data Scientists for Data Scientists.<br><br>Moreover, the framework will be released this year under an Open Source license which means that unlike other predictive APIs which only host one instance for Data Scientists to push their models to, this allows Data Scientists to completely control their own model codebase. In addition, it is deployable on Cloud Foundry and Heroku and can thus use some features of PaaS, which means less work in thinking about how to deploy and scale a model in production. <br><br>The model is implemented in Python and uses Flask to expose the REST API and the current prototype uses Redis as backend storage for the trained models. Models can be either custom-written or use existing Python ML libraries like scikit-learn. The framework is currently geared towards online learning, but it is possible to hook it up to a Spark backend to realize model training in batch on large datasets.

          Instrumentation has seen explosive adoption on the cloud in recent years. With the rise of micro-services we are now in an era where we measure the most trivial events in our systems. At Trademob, a mobile DSP with upwards of 125k requests per second across +700 instances, we generate and collect millions of  time-series data points. Gaining key insights from this data has proven to be a huge challenge.<br><br>Outlier and Anomaly detection are two techniques that help us comprehend the behavior of our systems and allow us to take actionable decisions with little or no human intervention. Outlier Detection is the identification of misbehavior across multiple subsystems and/or aggregation layers on a machine level, whereas Anomaly Detection lets us identify issues by detecting deviations against normal behavior on a temporal level. The analysis of these deviations is simplified through the use of a time and memory efficient data structure called a t-digest. With t-digests we are able to store error distributions with high accuracy, especially for extreme quantile values.<br><br>At Trademob, we developed a Python-based real-time monitoring system to conquer those challenges in order to reduce false positive alerts and increase overall business performance. By correlating a multitude of metrics we can determine system interdependencies, preemptively detect issues and also gain key insights to causality. This session will provide insights into both the system’s architecture and the algorithms used to detect unwanted behaviors.

          Python is a great language. But it can be slow compared to other languages for certain types of tasks. If applied appropriately, optimization may reduce program runtime or memory consumption considerably. But this often comes at a price. Optimization can be time consuming and the optimized program may be more complicated. This, in turn, means more maintenance effort. How do you find out if it is worthwhile to optimize your program? Where should you start? This tutorial will help you to answer these questions. You will learn how to find  an optimization strategy based on quantitative and objective criteria.<br>You will experience that one's gut feeling what to optimize is often wrong.<br><br>The solution to this problem is: „Measure, Measure, and Measure!“. You will learn how to measure program run times as well as profile CPU and memory.<br>There are great tools available. You will learn how to use some of them. Measuring is not easy because, by definition, as soon as you start to measure, you influence your system. Keeping this impact as small as possible is important. Therefore, we will cover different measuring techniques.<br><br>Furthermore, we will look at algorithmic improvements. You will see that the right data structure for the job can make a big difference. Finally, you will learn about different caching techniques.<br><br><a href="https://goo.gl/uXKJt0">Tutorial prerequisites and instructions.</a>

          In recent years, the adoption of electric cars has resulted in a desperate need from carmakers for accurate range prediction. In addition, fuel efficiency is of increasing concern due to today’s ever-rising fuel costs. In this talk, we will outline a machine learning framework for real-time data analysis to demonstrate how live data collected from cars can be used to provide valuable information for range prediction and smart navigation.<br><br>For our solution, we use a Bluetooth dongle that connects to a standard OBD II car diagnostics data port. Together with a self-developed iOS app we can then stream OBD II data into our framework’s big data infrastructure for long-term storage, batch training processes, and subsequent real-time analysis. We will show how we used different open-source technologies (Spark. Spring XD, Python and others) to stream, store, and reason over this data in a scalable way.<br><br>In particular, we will focus on how we designed the machine learning framework to derive individual driver ‘fingerprints’ from variables such as speed, acceleration, driving times, and location, taken from historical data. These fingerprints are then used within the real-time prediction framework to determine final journey destination and driving behavior in real time during the journey. We will also look at how other public and free data sources such as traffic information, weather, and fuel station locations could be used to further improve the accuracy and scope of our models.<br><br>This talk is intended to demonstrate pioneering work in the space of big data and the connected car. We will take into consideration the insights we have gained from building this prototype, both into infrastructure and analysis, to give our view on what such real-time driving intelligence applications of tomorrow could look like.

          For all e-commerce sites, marketing is a big part of the business and marketing efficiency and effectiveness are critical to their success. Companies must make many data-driven decisions in order to reach customers that their competitors don’t, maximize the revenue of each click, decide wisely what are the costs to cut, enter new markets, etc.<br><br>GetYourGuide has been working for more than two years on building a marketing intelligence that allows us growing our marketing efforts in the travel market without building a huge team or buying extremely expensive tools.<br><br>All the decisions are supported by a dedicated system that runs on the PyData stack that allows marketers to extract valuable insights from data and performs critical marketing tasks: keyword mining, campaign automation, predictive modeling, omni-channel marketing data integration, customer segmentation, pattern mining from click data, etc.<br><br>As a result of this, we were able to scale up 3 times our marketing efforts, launch campaigns in 13 markets and automate 75% of our work only in the last 8 months. But this is not the end of our journey, GetYourGuide is building a Data Science team to understand travelers needs and wants and make our Customers' trips amazing.

          Instrumentation has seen explosive adoption on the cloud in recent years. With the rise of micro-services we are now in an era where we measure the most trivial events in our systems. At Trademob, a mobile DSP with upwards of 125k requests per second across +700 instances, we generate and collect millions of  time-series data points. Gaining key insights from this data has proven to be a huge challenge.<br><br>Outlier and Anomaly detection are two techniques that help us comprehend the behavior of our systems and allow us to take actionable decisions with little or no human intervention. Outlier Detection is the identification of misbehavior across multiple subsystems and/or aggregation layers on a machine level, whereas Anomaly Detection lets us identify issues by detecting deviations against normal behavior on a temporal level. The analysis of these deviations is simplified through the use of a time and memory efficient data structure called a t-digest. With t-digests we are able to store error distributions with high accuracy, especially for extreme quantile values.<br><br>At Trademob, we developed a Python-based real-time monitoring system to conquer those challenges in order to reduce false positive alerts and increase overall business performance. By correlating a multitude of metrics we can determine system interdependencies, preemptively detect issues and also gain key insights to causality. This session will provide insights into both the system’s architecture and the algorithms used to detect unwanted behaviors.
